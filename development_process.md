# My JavaScript Project Development Process

## 1. Plan project, imagine interface

This project will be a single page application that uses with my Flatiron Ruby on Rails project, Recipe Costs, as the backend API.

**Project Goals**
1. Provide as much original Rails functionality in JavaScript as possible, including OAuth authentication.
2. Improve on existing Rails functionality to create a fast, intuitive interface.

**App Features**
- Users can log in directly or with their Google account.
- Authenticated users can create, read, update, and delete their own recipes and ingredients.
- Recipe costs are calculated per recipe and per serving.
- Ingredient conversions are automatic. Recipe amounts entered as cups will seamlessly take advantage of costs entered as liters or gallons, for example.
- App-wide ingredients and default costs provide faster recipe creation, and users can customize ingredient prices for their own recipes.
- Users can browse their full recipe list or recipes by ingredient.
